<h1 id="gamma-rhythms-30-80-hz">Gamma Rhythms (30-80 Hz)</h1>
<h2 id="getting-started.">Getting Started.</h2>
<p>In order to understand the workflow and initial parameter sets
provided with this tutorial, we must first briefly describe prior
studies on the mechanistic origin of gamma rhythms, including our prior
modeling work that led to the creation of the parameter sets you will
work with [1].</p>
<p>Gamma rhythms can encompass a wide band of frequencies from 30-150
Hz. Here, we will focus on the generation of so called low gamma rhythms
in the 30-80 Hz range. It has been well established through experiments
and computational modeling that these rhythms can emerge in local
spiking networks through interactions of excitatory cell and inhibitory
cell interactions, with the period of the oscillation set by the time
constant of decay of GABAA-mediated inhibitory currents [2–4], a
mechanism that has been referred to as pyramidal-interneuronal gamma
(PING). In normal regimes, the decay time constant of GABAA-mediated
synapses (~25 ms) bounds oscillations to the low gamma frequency band
(~40 Hz).</p>
<p>In general, PING rhythms are initiated by “excitation” to the
excitatory (E) cells that causes spiking, which in turn synaptically
activates a spiking population of inhibitory (I) cells. In turn, these I
cells inhibit the E cells, preventing further E cell activity until the
E cells can overcome the effects of the inhibition (~25 ms later). The
pattern is repeated, creating a gamma frequency oscillation (~40 Hz, 40
spikes/second). This general principle is schematically described in
Figure 1 below. The frequency of the rhythm is paced by this time
constant of decay of inhibition, which is mediated by strong GABA-A
currents, as well as the excitability of the E cells (if the E cells are
very excitable, they can fire before the inhibition has completely worn
off, and the oscillation will be faster).</p>

Schematic illustration of the circuit mechanisms underlying PING
rhythms.
</p>
</div>
<p>In this tutorial, we will explore the generation of PING rhythms in
the HNN model. We will provide example parameter files and walk through
simulations that generate low-frequency gamma activity in both Layers
2/3 and Layer 5, as in [1]. This tutorial relies on a different type of
exogenous drive to “activate” the local network than the other
tutorials. Here, the necessary excitation to generate spiking in the
pyramidal neurons (E cells) that initiates the rhythm (see PING
description above) is provided by a continuous train of action
potentials with a Poisson distribution (Poisson Input) that activate
post-synaptic excitatory AMPA synapses on the pyramidal neurons. This
Poisson drive causes the pyramidal neurons to fire, dependent on the
chosen conductance of the AMPA currents. The inhibition in the network
is strong enough to overcome the Poisson drive and entrain the network
spiking into a gamma frequency rhythm.</p>
<p>Of note, gamma rhythms can be generated by circuit mechanisms other
than PING, including subthreshold rhythmic exogenous drive. Lee and
Jones (2013) examined various mechanisms of generation of gamma activity
and described ways to distinguish the mechanisms of generation based on
features of current dipole signal [1]. After completing this tutorial,
we encourage you to explore alternate mechanisms of gamma generation and
to compare to your own gamma data.</p>

<p>This will open the GUI in your local browser, as shown below</p>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_01.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Configuration files that will simulate PING rhythms as described in
the Getting Started section above are provided in the
<a href="https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-data">hnn-data GitHub
repository</a>. You will need to either clone the hnn-data repository or
download its contents to your machine to follow along with this
tutorial. The configuration file we will begin with is
<code>gamma_L5weak_L2weak.json</code>.</p>
<p>Before we load in the configuration file, let’s update the parameters
in the <code>Simulation</code> tab.</p>
<p>If you have the <a
href="https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/parallel.html">MPI
backend</a> for parallel simulations installed, you can change the
backend from Joblib to MPI for faster simulation times. Otherwise, you
can leave this option as is. We will keep <code>Trials</code> (the
number of trials to simulate) as 1 and the integration timestep
<code>dt (ms)</code> as 0.025 for now. Next, we will change the
<code>tstop (ms)</code> parameter to 250 for a longer simulation.
Lastly, we will change the <code>Name</code> to
<code>gamma_L5weak_L2weak</code> to refect the network configuration
we’ll be starting with.</p>
<h2

Load/view parameters to “activate” the network and to define the network
structure</h2>
<p>To load the initial parameters for the inputs that drive our network,
navigate to the <code>External Drives</code> tab and click
<code>Load External Drives</code>. From the popup window, navigate to
the ‘network-configurations’ subfolder in the ‘hnn-data’ directory, and
select the <code>gamma_L5weak_L2weak.json</code> configuration file.</p>
<p>You should now see a dropdown menu labelled ‘extpois (proximal)’
which contains the adjustable drive parameters, as shown in Figure 2
below.</p>
<h4 id="figure-2">Figure 2</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_02.gif" /></p>
</div>
<p>In this simulation, the network will be “activated” with excitatory
AMPA synaptic input, distributed in time as a Poisson process and
delivered to the somas of the pyramidal neurons in Layer 2/3 (L2/3) and
Layer 5 (L5). This noisy input will generate spiking activity in the
pyramidal neurons that can initiate the PING rhythm.</p>
<h3 id="load-network-parameters">Load Network Parameters</h3>
<p>Next, navigate to the <code>Network</code> tab and select
<code>Load local network connectivity</code>. From the popup window,
select the <code>gamma_L5weak_L2weak.json</code> configuration file from
the ‘network-configurations’ subfolder in the ‘hnn-data’ directory.</p>
<p>The adjustable network parameters are displayed in the dropdown boxes
under the <code>Connectivity</code> tab, as shown in Figure 3 below.</p>
<h4 id="figure-3">Figure 3</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_03.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>In our loaded configuration file, all synaptic connections within the
network are turned off (weight = 0 <span
class="math inline"><em>μ</em><em>S</em></span>), except for the
reciprocal connections between the excitatory (AMPA only) and inhibitory
(GABAA only) cells within the same layer. In other words, the Layer 2/3
and Layer 5 networks are not connected to each other (see the <a
href="https://hnn.brown.edu/under-the-hood/">Under the Hood</a> section
of the HNN website for further details on connectivity structure).</p>
<p>Note also that the inhibitory conductances within layers are stronger
than the excitatory conductances, and there are also strong
inhibitory-to-inhibitory (i.e., basket-to-basket) connections. This
strong autonomous inhibition will cause synchrony among the basket
cells, and hence strong inhibition onto the pyramidal neurons (note:
this synapse was not depicted in Figure 1).</p>

Keep in mind that because Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 are not connected, this

<p>The console below the <code>Run</code> button will print progress as
the simulation is running. Once it is complete, the input histogram and
the dipole will be plotted in the right-most panel, as shown in Figure 4
below.</p>
<h4 id="figure-4">Figure 4</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_04.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>A histogram displaying the Poisson drive to the excitatory cells is
shown in the top panel, displaying no clear rhythmicity at the gamma
frequency.</p>
<p>We will show the spiking plot in the next section, but for now keep
in mind that the Poisson drive provided causes pyramidal neurons to
fire, which in-turn cause the inhibitory neurons to fire. Feedback
inhibition from the interneurons to the pyramidal neurons generates a
regular gamma rhythm via the PING mechanism described above, which we
can see in the rhythmicity of the simulated dipole. The sharp downward
deflections in the dipole are reflective of the strong inhibition onto
the pyramidal neuron somas, which pulls current flow down the
dendrites.</p>
<p>To view the Spectrogram, select the <code>Visualization</code> tab.
You will see a <code>Layout template</code> menu at the top, also shown
in Figure 4 above. From this menu, select the
<code>Dipole-Spectrogram (2x1)</code> option and then click the
<code>Make Figure</code> button. This will generate a new figure, as
shown below</p>

<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_05.png" /></p>

<p>The spectrogram confirms that, for this network and drive
configuration, the dipole signal contains oscillatory components in the
gamma range (~50 Hz).</p>

<h2
id="calculating-and-viewing-spiking-activity-and-power-spectral-density-psd">3.
Calculating and Viewing Spiking Activity and Power Spectral Density
(PSD)</h2>
<p>We can make a new figure to view the spiking activity generated by
the different neuron populations in the network.</p>
<p>From the <code>Layout template</code> menu in the
<code>Visualization</code> tab, select
<code>[Blank] single figure</code> and click the
<code>Make figure</code> button. This will open up a new figure tab with
a single subplot named <code>ax0</code>. Under the <code>Type</code>
dropdown box, select <code>spikes</code> and click
<code>Add plot</code>, as shown in Figure 6 below.</p>
<h4 id="figure-6">Figure 6</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_06.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that the excitatory pyramidal neurons in each layer (green and
red dots / lines) fire before the inhibitory basket cells in each layer
(white, blue dots / lines). The pyramidal neuron firing drives the
basket cells to fire. The basket cells are highly synchronous due to the
strong inhibitory-to-inhibitory connections. The basket cells then
prevent the pyramidal neurons from firing for ~25 ms, generating the
PING rhythms. The pyramidal neurons are firing periodically, but with
lower synchrony due to the Poisson drive, which creates randomized spike
times across the populations (once the inhibition sufficiently wears
off). This type of dispersed pyramidal neuron firing is considered
“weak” PING - hence the configuration file name including “weak” in the
name.</p>
<p>We can further confirm that this oscillation is in the gamma
frequency range by viewing the power spectral density of the current
dipole signal (average spectrogram across time).</p>
<p>To view the PSD from this simulation, select the
<code>PSD Layers (3x1)</code> option from the
<code>Layout template</code> menu in the <code>Visualization</code> tab,
and click the <code>Make figure</code> button.</p>
<h4 id="figure-7">Figure 7</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_07.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that the power in the gamma band is smaller in Layer 2/3 than
in Layer 5. This is reflective, in part, of the fact that the length of
the Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons is smaller than Layer 5, and hence Layer
2/3 cells produce smaller current dipole moments that can be masked by
activity in Layer 5 (see [1] for further discussion).</p>
<p><a id="toc_4"></a></p>
<h2 id="adjusting-parameters">4 Adjusting parameters</h2>
<p>In the following sections, we explore the impacts of two key
parameters controlling gamma rhythmicity: cell excitability and network
connectivity</p>
<p>Cell “excitability” can be adjusted in many ways, reflecting the
intrinsic properties of a neuron (e.g. membrane resting potential)
and/or the influence of external factors such as noisy background inputs
neuromodulation.</p>
<p>Parameters controlling network connectivity include the synaptic
connection strengths between cells and/or the time constants of synaptic
activation.</p>
<h3 id="section">4.1</h3>
<p>To explore the influence of these factors on gamma rhythmicity, we
will examine activity in only one of the layers, namely Layer 5, by
setting all inputs and connectivity in Layer 2/3 to zero.</p>
<p>First, navigate to the <code>Simulation</code> tab and change the
<code>Name</code> to reflect the fact that we will be running a new
simulation. We’ll use the name <code>gamma_L5weak_only</code>.</p>
<p>Next, navigate to the <code>Connectivity</code> section under the
<code>Network</code> tab and change all of the Layer 2/3 weights to
0.</p>
<p>Finally, select the <code>extpois (proximal)</code> drive under the
<code>External drives</code> tab and set the Layer 2/3 weights to 0.</p>
<p>Once you’ve set all of the Layer 2/3 weights to zero, click the
<code>Run</code> button to run the simulation. The simulation will yield
a gamma rhythm that looks similar to the one we observed previously, as
shown in Figure 8 below.</p>
<h4 id="figure-8">Figure 8</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_08.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>However, if you view the Simulation Spiking Activity and the PSD (see
step 3 above) you will see activity from only Layer 5.</p>
<p>You can follow the same steps as outlined in Section 3 above to
generate these visualizations. Note, however, that you need to have the
correct simulation selected via the <code>Dataset</code> dropdown box
under the <code>Vizualization</code> tab and above the
<code>Make figure</code> button, as shown in Figure 9b below.</p>
<h4 id="figure-9.a">Figure 9.A</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">

<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_09_02.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Notice the weak PING rhythm in Layer 5 consisting of weakly
synchronous pyramidal neuron firing, followed by synchronous inhibitory
neuron firing, that gates the network dipole rhythm to ~50 Hz.</p>
<h3 id="increasing-cell-excitability-via-a-weak-tonic-input">4.1.1
Increasing cell excitability via a weak tonic input</h3>
<p>To examine the impact of cell excitability on gamma expression, we
can increase the excitability of the Layer 5 pyramidal neurons by adding
a tonic applied current that might represent a neuromodulatory
influence.</p>
<p>To do so, first select the <code>External drives</code> tab, then
select the <code>Tonic</code> option under <code>Drive</code> and click
the <code>Add drive</code> button. This will create a new external drive
titled <code>Tonic1</code>, as shown in Figure 10 below. Select the new
drive, and then set the amplitude of the tonic drive to the Layer 5
pyramidal neuron to be 2 nA. This level of injected current will be
applied to the soma of the L5 Pyramidal neurons for the duration of the
simulation.</p>
<h4 id="figure-10.a">Figure 10.A</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">

<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_10_02.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>After adding the tonic drives, change the simulation name to
<code>gamma_L5weak_tonic</code>, and then click the <code>Run</code>
button. The simulation will yield the output shown in Figure 11
below.</p>
<h4 id="figure-11.a">Figure 11.A</h4>

</div>
<p>Note that network takes longer to stabilize due to the initial impact
of the tonic current. From about 50 ms onward, we see that the initial
impact of the tonic input has subsided and the influence of both the
tonic and Poisson drives is more evident.</p>
<p>Figure 11.B shows the spike plot from the previous simulation
(<code>gamma_L5weak</code>) on the top and the spike plot from the
latest simulation (<code>gamma_L5weak_tonic</code>) on the bottom. We
see that by introducing a weak tonic input, the pyramidal neuron spiking
is visibly more synchronous, though with some noise still present from
the Poisson drive.</p>
<p>Figure 11.C similarly shows the spectrograms, with previous
simulation (<code>gamma_L5weak</code>) on the top and the latest
simulation (<code>gamma_L5weak_tonic</code>) on the bottom. We observe
that after the network stabilizes, the frequency of gamma appears to
have decreased slightly.</p>
<p>We see that while increasing the excitability causes the PNs to fire
more synchronously, interpreting the competing effects of excitation and
inhibition is not always straightforward. The moderately more
synchronous pyramidal neuron firing is not quite strong enough to induce
a “strong” PING in the local network. However, the overall increase in
the pyramidal neuron firing rate appears to more strongly recruit the
inhibitory interneurons, which has the overall effect of slightly
lowering the frequency of the ovserved gamma rhythm.</p>
<h3 id="weakening-the-excitatory-connections">4.1.2 Weakening the
excitatory connections</h3>
<p>We’ll now explore the impact of adjusting synaptic connectivity
parameters in the network.</p>
<p>First navigate to the <code>Connectivity</code> section of the
<code>Network</code> tab. From there, change the weight of the
<code>L5_pyramidal-&gt;L5_basket</code> connection from 0.00091 to
0.000091, making it 10 times weaker.</p>
<p>Change the <code>Name</code> of the simulation to
<code>gamma_L5weak_tonic_02</code>, and run the simulation. As we’ve
done in previous sections, you’ll want to generate visualizations that
show the spike plot and the spectrogram. In Figure 12.B, we display the
spiking and the spectrogram in a single plot rather than two separate
plots.</p>
<h4 id="figure-12.a">Figure 12.A</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_12_01.png" /></p>
</div>
<h4 id="figure-12.b">Figure 12.B</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_12_02.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>It is also instructive to view visualizations for different
simulations in the same figure to compare differences. Figure 13 below
shows the PSD for <code>gamma_L5weak_tonic</code> (top subplot) and
<code>gamma_L5weak_tonic_02</code> (bottom subplot)</p>
<h4 id="figure-13">Figure 13</h4>
<div style="display:block; width:90%; max-width:800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><img src="images/gamma_fig_13.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that the gamma rhythm has now slowed from ~45 Hz to ~40 Hz.
This slowing is due to the fact that the excitatory-to-inhibitory
connection was weakened. Due to this change, it now takes longer for the
basket cells to respond to the excitation, and hence the rhythm is
slowed.</p>
<h3 id="removing-the-inhibitory-connections">4.1.3 Removing the
inhibitory connections</h3>
<p>Next, we’ll explore the importance of the inhibitory connections in
setting gamma rhythmicity.</p>
<p>First from the <code>Network</code> section of the
<code>Connectivity</code> tab, change the weight of the
<code>L5_pyramidal-&gt;L5_basket</code> connection back to 0.00091.</p>
<p>Then navigate to the <code>External drives</code> tab and select the
<code>Tonic1</code> drive. Click the <code>Delete drive</code> button to
remove this drive.</p>
<p>We are now back to the Layer 5 weak PING configuration

<p>Notice that the rhythm is still present but less regular and noisier
(compare with first waveform image in this section 4.1 above). You can
also observe this in the Simulation Spiking Activity (below). This lack
of regularity is due to the fact that removal of the inhibitory to
inhibitory connections caused the inhibition to be less synchronous and
noiser, in turn yielding a noisier PING rhythm.</p>

<p>Notice that the rhythm is now faster at ~ 60 Hz. As illustrated in
the spiking activity, the faster decay of inhibition allows the
pyramidal neurons to recover more quickly from the inhibition and
respond to the Poisson drive, resulting in a faster network
oscillation.</p>

<p>In this simulation, there are no spiking inputs provided to the
model; instead, a current clamp provides a constant depolarizing current
to the pyramidal neuron somas, causing the cells to fire. This firing
initiates the PING rhythm through mechanisms similar to that described
above. In contrast to the Poisson drive, the constant depolarization to
pyramidal neurons creates higher excitability in the pyramidal neurons,
causing more synchronous firing. In turn, this causes the interneurons
to fire synchronously, producing a higher amplitude gamma
oscillation.</p>
<p>In Figure 18 above we see that the dipole displays even sharper
downward deflections, caused by the strong synchronous inhibition onto
the pyramidal neuron somas that pulls current flow down the dendrites.
This PING rhythm has less variability and would thus be considered
“strong” PING rather than “weak” PING.</p>
<p>Let’s further explore this simulation by looking at the
layer-specific dipoles and the PSD. To generate this visualization,
select the <code>PSD Layers</code> option from the
<code>Layout template</code> dropdown in the <code>Visualization</code>
tab. Make sure you’ve sected the proper <code>Dataset</code>

<p>When looked at together, the spectrogram (Figure 18) and the PSD
(Figure 19) illustrate that the dipole signal contains strong
oscillatory components in the gamma range in the net dipole, which is
being driven by the strong Layer 5 activity. Layer 2/3 is oscillating at
higher frequency with a lower amplitude (note the scaling of the y-axes
in the layer-specific dipoles).</p>

<p>The PING mechanism is seen in each layer where the pyramidal neurons
fire, causing the inhibitory neurons to fire, which consequently keep
the pyramidal neurons from firing until their excitation outweighs the
inhibition. Notice that the firing rate of Layer 2/3 pyramidal and
basket neurons is faster than that of Layer 5 neurons. This is because
although the Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons receive a lower current
injection, they have shorter dendrites and therefore the current flow up
and down the dendrites is faster. Further, the Layer 2/3 pyramidal
neurons have lower spiking thresholds due to their intrinsic
properties.</p>
<p>In each layer, the inhibitory neurons are firing synchronously and
causing strong somatic inhibition on the pyramidal neurons, resulting in
fast downward current flow that creates the sharp dipole deflections
seen in the dipole waveforms above.</p>

While not shown in the figures above, there is an additional
higher-frequency component near 80 Hz in Layer 5 that can be seen in the
layer-specific PSD. The higher-frequency activity in Layer 5 comes from
the sharp deflections in the dipole waveform along with a
small-amplitude peak that together create high power at 80 Hz in the
frequency domain. These deflections are driven by the strong
depolarizing current on the pyramidal neurons that causes their voltage
to rise quickly even before the inhibitory neurons fire.

Gamma can emerge from rhythmic subthreshold synaptic inputs to pyramidal
neurons</h3>
<p>In the next example, we will apply 50 Hz rhythmic synaptic inputs
through proximal and distal projection patterns to produce gamma
oscillations similar to those shown in Figure 8A of (Lee &amp; Jones,
2013) [1].</p>
<p>In this simulation, the strength of the input is set so that the
cells remain subthreshold and gamma rhythms emerge from subthreshold
current flow in the pyramidal neuron dendrites, rather than local
spiking interactions as in the PING mechanisms described above.</p>
<p>First, navigate to the <code>Network</code> tab and load the
<code>gamma_rhythmic_drive</code> configuration from the
<code>hnn_data</code> folder. Next, select the
<code>External drives</code> tab and similarly load the subthreshold
drives from the <code>gamma_rhythmic_drive</code> file. You will see two
drives named <code>bursty1 (proximal)</code> and
<code>bursty2 (distal)</code></p>
<p>In this example, the pyramidal neurons receive inputs, and the
interneurons do not. The proximal and distal inputs start at 50.0 and
55.0 ms, respectively, and are slightly out of phase to allow synaptic
inputs to effectively push current flow up the dendrites, followed 5 ms
later by current flow down the dendrites. Additionally, the input
frequency (as indicated by the <code>burst rate</code> parameter) for
both proximal and distal inputs is set to a 50 Hz, representing “bursts”
of excitatory synaptic input. The driving burst has an
inter-burst-interval of 20 ms, with minimal noise within each driving
burst (as indicated by the <code>Burst std dev</code> of 2.5 ms).</p>

<p>Note also that the amplitude of the inputs, which are only provided
to the Layer 5 pyramidal neurons, is set to a small value 0.00004, which
produces only subthreshold responses in the Layer 5 pyramidal neurons.
As a result, the gamma mechanism shown in this simulation is
fundamentally different from the previous examples, since it does not
rely on the local spiking interactions that underlie the PING
mechanism.</p>

<p>The net dipole signal in this simulation shows a clear gamma rhythm
at ~50 Hz, produced by the Layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Note, here the
Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons are not receiving any drive and hence do not
contribute to the dipole current. There is only minor stochasticity to
the synaptic inputs (burst stdev of 2.5 ms). Also note that the waveform
shape in this simulation is distinct from the previous examples, lacking
the sharp deflections produced by neuronal firing and strong somatic
inhibition during PING.</p>

Adding noise to gamma generate through rhythmic subthreshold synaptic

the previously applied 50 Hz rhythmic drive.</p>
<p>For each of the drives in the <code>External drives</code> tab,
change the value of the <code>Burst std dev</code> from 2.5 ms to 5 ms.
This increase adds variability to the timing of the burst of synaptic
drive each input provides, and hence adds more “noise” to the

<p>Due to the higher variability in synaptic input timing, there is now
more variability in the temporal dynamics and frequency content seen in
the dipole signal in the simulation above. This is seen in the
intermittent 50 Hz gamma events visible in the wavelet spectrogram.</p>
<p>With the added noise, we also observe lower-frequency peaks with
relatively high power in the average PSD, though the intermittent gamma
events still yield the highest-power peak observed in the PSD.</p>
