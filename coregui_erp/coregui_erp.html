<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>In order to understand the workflow and initial parameter sets
provided with this tutorial, we must first briefly describe prior
studies that led to the creation of the provided data and evoked
response parameter set that you will work with. This tutorial is based
on results from our 2007 study where we recorded and simulated tactile
evoked responses source localized to the primary somatosensory cortex
(SI) [1].</p>
<p>In our 2007 study, we investigated the early evoked activity (0-175
ms) elicited by a brief tap to the D3 digit and source localized to an
an equivalent current dipole in the contralateral hand area of the
primary somatosensory cortex (SI) [1]. The strength of the tap was set
at either suprathreshold (100% detection probability) or perceptual
threshold (50% detection) levels (see Figure 1, left panel below). Note,
to be precise, this data represents source localized event related field
(ERF) activity because it was collected using MEG. We use the
terminology ERP for simplicity, since the primary current dipoles
generating evoked fields and potentials are the same.</p>
<p>We found that we could reproduce evoked responses that accurately
reflected the recorded waveform in our neocortical model from a layer
specific sequence of exogenous excitatory synaptic drive to the local SI
circuit, see Figure 1right panel below. This drive consisted of
“feedforward” / proximal input at ~25 ms post-stimulus, followed by
“feedback” / distal input at ~60 ms, followed by a subsequent
“feedforward” / proximal input at ~125 ms (Gaussian distribution of
input times on each simulated trial). This sequence of drive generated
spiking activity and intracellular dendritic current flow in the
pyramidal neuron dendrites to reproduce the current dipole signal. This
sequence of drive can be interpreted as initial “feedforward” input from
the lemniscal thalamus, followed by “feedback” input from higher order
cortex or non-lemniscal thalamus, followed by a re-emergent leminsical
thalamic drive. Intracranial recordings in non-human primates motivated
and supported this assumption [2].</p>
<p>In our model, the exogenous driving inputs were simulated as
predefined trains of action potentials (pre-synaptic spikes) that
activated excitatory synapses in the local cortical circuit in proximal
and distal projection patterns (i.e. feedforward, and feedback,
respectively, as shown schematically in Figure 1 right, and in the HNN
GUI Model Schematics). The number, timing and strength (post-synaptic
conductance) of the driving spikes were manually adjusted in the model
until a close representation of the data was found (all other model
parameters were tuned and fixed based on the morphology, physiology and
connectivity within layered neocortical circuits) [1]. Note, a scaling
factor was applied to net dipole output to match to the magnitude of the
recorded ERP data and used to predict the number of neurons contributing
to the recorded ERP (purple circle, Figure 1, right panel). The dipole
units were in nAm, with a one-to-one comparison between data and model
output due to the biophysical detail in our model.</p>

</p>
<p>In summary, to simulate the SI evoked response, a sequence of
exogenous excitatory synaptic drive was simulated (by creating
presynaptic spikes that activate layer specific synapses in the
neocortical network) consisting of proximal drive at ~25 ms, followed by
distal drive at ~60 ms, followed by a second proximal drive at ~122 ms.

of simulating a similar ERP, using a subset of the data shown in Figure

<h2 id="loadview-data">1. Load/view data</h2>
<p>An example ERP dataset is provided in the
<a href="https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-data">hnn-data GitHub
repository</a>. We use the data as an orienting example for where to
begin to simulate an ERP.</p>
<p>This dataset represents early evoked activity (0-175 ms) from an
equivalent current dipole source localized to the hand area of the
primary somatosensory cortex (SI), elicited by a brief perceptual
threshold level tap to the contralateral D3 digit (read Getting Started
above for details). The example dataset provided was collected at 600Hz
and contains only averaged data from 100 trials in which the tap was
detected. (Note, when loading your own data, if it was not collected at
600Hz, you must first downsample to 600Hz to view it in the HNN
GUI).</p>
<p>To load and view this data, navigate to the main GUI window and on
the bottom left corner click: <code>Load data</code></p>
<p>If you have cloned the hnn-data repository, navigate to hnn-data
folder on your desktop and select
<code>MEG_detection_data/yes_trial_S1_ERP_all_avg.txt</code>. HNN will
then load the data and display the waveform in the dipole window as
shown below.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have not cloned the hnn-data repository, you
can download the file directly by clicking

<p>The template cortical column networks structure for this simulation
is described in the <a href="https://hnn.brown.edu/under-the-hood/">“HNN
Template Model” page</a> on the hnn.brown.edu website. Several of the
network parameter can be adjusted via the HNN GUI (e.g., local
excitatory and inhibitory connection strengths) under the
<code>Network connectivity</code> tab, but we will leave them fixed for
this tutorial and only adjust the inputs that “activate” the
network.</p>
<p>The values of the parameters that you loaded to “activate” the
network in a manner that will generate an evoked response can now be
viewed under the <code>External drives</code> tab. As described in the
“Getting Started” section, the evoked response can be simulated with a
sequence of exogenous driving inputs consisting of a proximal input at
~26 ms (evprox1), followed by a distal input at ~64 ms (evdist1),
followed by a subsequent proximal input at ~137 ms (evprox).</p>
<p>To see the detailed parameter values defining each of these drives
click on the dropdown button next to the name of each drive. Note:
additional evoked proximal or distal inputs can be added to your
simulation for your hypothesis testing goals by using the
<code>Add drive</code> button and specifying the drive as “Evoked” and
the location as either “proximal” or “distal”. Other types of drives can
also be defined including poisson, rhythmic, and tonic, as detailed in
other tutorials.</p>

<p>Each evoked input consists of a Gaussian distributed train of
presynaptic action potentials that will target all of the cells in the
post-synaptic network, with several adjustable parameters, including the
mean arrival and standard deviation of the time each spike activates the
network (in milliseconds), the number of the driving spikes on each
trial of the simulation, and a random number seed that enables
reproducibility of simulation results across trials. You can also adjust
the postsynaptic conductance of the drive onto the postsynaptic cell.
For example, under the “AMPA weights” section in the “evprox1” dropdown
menu, the L5_pyramidal field represents the the post synaptic AMPA
conductance of the proximal input onto the layer 5 pyramidal neuron at
each location targeted by the proximal drive. For further details on the
connectivity structure of the network, see the

<h2 id="running-the-simulation-and-visualizing-net-current-dipole">3.
Running the simulation and visualizing net current dipole</h2>
<p>Now that we have an initial parameter set, we can run a simulation
for a set number or trials. Let’s start by defining 3 trials, by
clicking on the <code>Simulation</code> tab and defining Trials=3. On
each simulated trial, the timings of the evoked inputs (i.e., spikes)
are chosen from a Gaussian distribution with mean and stdev (standard
deviation) as defined in the “Evoked drives” tap. Histograms of each of
the evoked inputs will be displayed at the top of the Figure tab after
the simulations run.</p>
<p>Before running the simulation, we’ll first change the simulation name
(i.e., the name under which the simulated data will be saved) to a new
descriptive-name for the simulation here. Under the
<code>Simulation</code> tab, change the name from “default” to
“ERPyes-3trials”. (Note that the default simulation is in fact 1 run of
the “ERPyes” simulation.) There are several other adjustable simulate
parameters in the <code>Simulation</code> tab. These parameters control
the duration (stop), integration time step (dt), number of trials
(Trials), and the choice of the simulation backend of either MPI
(parallel across neurons) or Joblib (parallel across trials), assuming
both backends are installed.</p>
<p>Hit the <code>Run</code> button to run the simulation. A simulation
log is shown under the Run button that will tell you the status of your
simulaion.</p>

<h3>Figure 5</h3>
<p><img src="images/erp_fig_05.png" /></p>
</section>
<p>Once complete, a new Figure 2 window will appear showing the output
of the simulation as in the figure below. The thin blue traces are net
current dipole signals from individual trials while the thick blue trace
is the average ERP, with histograms of the proximal and distal driving
spikes shown above.</p>
<p>Next, let’s create a new figure to view the simulation on top of the
loaded data. Click on the <code>Visualization</code> tab and select the
<code>[blank] 2row x 1col (1:3)</code> option from the
<code>Layout template</code> dropdown menu, then select
<code>Make figure</code>.</p>
<p>You will see that our new figure has two subplots defined by ax0 and
ax1, both of which are blank. Select the ax1 subplot and set the
<code>Simution Data</code> to <code>ERPyes-3trials</code>. Set
<code>Data to compare</code> to <code>yes_trial_S1_ERP_all_avg</code>,
then click <code>Add plot</code>.</p>
<p>Next, select ax0, set the <code>Type</code> to
<code>input histogram</code>, and click <code>Add plot</code>.</p>
<p>Note you can change what is shown in either of these subplots by
selecting <code>clear axis</code>, picking the <code>Type</code> of data
from the pulldown menu, and clicking <code>Add plot</code>.</p>

style="display:block; width:90%; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Figure 6</h3>
<p><img src="images/erp_fig_06.gif" /></p>
</section>
<p>Importantly, note that a scaling factor of 3000.00 was multiplied by
the net dipole produced by the model, as seen on the y-axis scale in the
figure above. This scaling factor can be adjusted to match the magnitude
of the recorded data; the value of 3000 is the default value for the
loaded parameter set. In this case, since the template model contains
200 pyramidal neurons (PNs), the simulation predicts that the number of
cells that contribute to the signal is 600,000 (200 x 3000) PNs.</p>
<p>Also note that in the ERP simulation shown, the raw dipole signal was
smoothed using a Hamming filter using a window size of 30 milliseconds,
in order to reduce noise in the ERP signal generated by this reduced
network model. The level of smoothing can be adjusted by changing the
value of the Dipole Smooth Window (ms). The longer the window, the more
smoothing will occur. To turn off smoothing entirely, set the window
size to 0. Below, we provide an example of the same simulation with
smoothing turned off entirely. Note the higher-frequency content
compared to the ERP simulation with smoothing turned on.</p>

A closer look inside the simulations: contribution of layers and cell
types</h2>
<p>One of the main advantages of simulating neocortical activity is that
we can dive into the details of the simulation to investigate the
contribution of different components in the network; e.g., layers, cell
types, etc. HNN currently enables the viewing of the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Layer-specific dipole activity</li>
<li>Spiking activity in each individual neuron population</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4.1 Viewing layer specific current dipoles</strong></p>
<p>From the <code>Visualization</code> tab, select “Dipole Layers (3x1)”
from the <code>Layout template</code> dropdown menu. From the
<code>Dataset</code> dropdown, select the simulation data you would like
to visualize. Next, click <code>Make figure</code> to generate a new
figure.</p>
<section id="figure-8"
style="display:block; width:90%; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Figure 8</h3>
<p><img src="images/erp_fig_08.png" /></p>
</section>
<p>The new figure shows the dipole contributions from Layer 2/3 (top),
Layer 5 (middle), and the aggregate (bottom). Note the different
features in Layer 2/3 vs Layer 5 dipole signals, allowing you to tease
apart how the different cortical layers contribute to different net
waveform features. In this figure, the light blue traces are from
individual trials (n=2), and the dark blue trace is the average across
trials. The same dipole scaling factor (3000.0) is applied.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Viewing network spiking activity</strong></p>
<p>From the <code>Visualization</code> tab, select “Drive-Spikes (2x1)”
from the <code>Layout template</code> dropdown menu. From the
<code>Dataset</code> dropdown, select the simulation data you would like

</section>
<p>This window shows the spiking activity produced in each population in
response to the evoked inputs. The top two panels show histograms of
distal evoked inputs (green) and proximal evoked inputs (red) provided
to the neurons. The large third panel shows a raster plot of the spiking
activity generated by the individual neurons, with different populations
in different colors as labeled (x-axis: time in ms; y-axis: neuron
identifier). The neuron identifiers are arranged vertically by layer,
with top representing supragranular layers and the bottom representing
the infragranular layers. Individual neuron types are drawn in the
different colors shown in the legend. The dotted lines in the bottom
panel show a time-series of summed activity per population (these use
the same color code as the individual spikes; you can turn these lines
off or on by selecting View&gt; Toggle Histograms). The initial view
shows the aggregate spiking activity across trials. To see spiking
activity generated by a single trial, select the trial number using the
combination box at the bottom of the window. This spike viewer window
also provides the standard save/navigation functionality through the
matplotlib control at the top.</p>

<p>When loading data, the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) is calculate
between the average simulated ERP waveform and the loaded waveform. Our
<code>ERPyes-3trial</code> simulation yields an RMSE of 5.51.</p>
<p>Let’s run a simulation with 10 trials and see how the RMSE
changes.</p>
<p>Notice that when we simulated more trials, the RMSE between the data
and the simulated average ERP changed to 5.59. Depending on the number
of trials you run and what adjustments you make to the parameter values,
you may be able to reduce the RMSE.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-parameters">6. Adjusting parameters</h2>
<p>Parameter adjustments will be key to developing and testing
hypotheses on the circuit origin of your own ERP data. HNN is designed
so that many of parameters in the model can be adjusted from the GUI
(see Tour of the GUI). Here, we’ll walk through examples of how to
adjust several “External drives” parameters to investigate how they
impact the evoked response.</p>
<p><strong>6.1 Changing the synchrony of the evoked inputs</strong></p>
<p>In the example evoked response simulation described in Step 3, the
time that each exogenous driving spike was provided to each cell in the
local network was chosen independently from a Gaussian distribution, for
both the proximal and distal inputs; this variability in timing created
variability in the response of each cell in the network. Asynchronous
exogenous drive is the default configuration in HNN. HNN also provides
the capability to provide exogenous driving inputs to all cells in the
network synchronously (0ms lag); this will reduce variability in timing
of evoked inputs, producing a stronger response, and may or may not
provide a better fit to the data.</p>
<p>To change the evoked inputs to contact the cells in network
synchronously, first change the simulation name something like
“ERPYes2TrialsSync” in <code>Simulation</code>. This will save the
simulation data to a file with this new name.</p>
<p>Then, to provide synchronous exogenous drives to all cells in the
network, go to <code>External drives</code> and set the
<code>Std dev time</code> for all drives to 0.</p>
<section id="figure-12"
style="display:block; width:90%; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Figure 12</h3>
<p><img src="images/erp_fig_12.png" /></p>
</section>
<p>After the simulation has completed, you’ll see the following output.
Although the model replicates some gross features of the experimental
data, the fit to the data is now substantially worse (RMSE = 14.15).
Notice also that there is significantly lower variability of the input
times in the histograms at the top of the figure (compare to evoked
response inputs shown in Step 5), predicting (in this case) the evoked
responses are more likely to be non-synchronous. Remember, however, that
this simulation is only based on two trials.</p>

<!-- **6.2 Changing the timing and strength (post-synaptic conductance) of the evoked inputs**

For this part of the tutorial, we’ll load a different experimental data set into the GUI. The new experimental data represents the evoked response from non-detected threshold level stimuli in the experiment described in the “Getting Started” section above [1]. We will adjust the parameters to better fit our simulation to the non-detected threshold level data.

First, let's load the data from the non-detected trials `no_trial_S1_ERP_all_avg.json`.

Notice that the timing and magnitude of the peaks in this new data set are quite different from the evoked responses that were detected.

HNN will automatically recalculate the model fit to the data (i.e, the RMSE between the average model response and the loaded data) based on the prior simulations (Step 6.1), showing that the previously used parameter set gave a poor fit to the new data (RMSE = 30.83).

<div style="display:block; width:90%; margin: 0 auto;">

### Figure 14  

![](images/erp_fig_14.png)

</div>

Notice that the magnitudes of the peaks in the model are larger than the data, and the timing of the peaks is faster.

What might account for these differences between our simulation and the data for the nondetected trials? We can formulate some hypotheses and use HNN to test it. 

Given the timing and magnitude differences we see in the plot, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these difference can be accounted by 
1. A decrease in the strength of the inputs that created the evoked response, and
2. A delay in the arrival time of these inputs to the network. 

To test these hypotheses, we’ll adjust the parameters as described. For simplicity, we have created a parameter file, which accounts for such changes and accurately reproduces the new data. Let's load the `ERPNo100Trials.json` file into `External Drives`.

You should see the new values in the dropdowns.

<div style="display:block; width:90%; margin: 0 auto;">

### Figure 15 

![](images/erp_fig_15.png)

</div>

Let's take a closer look at what parameters we changed. 

Notice that in a given layer, weights (post-synaptic conductances) of the evoked inputs to pyramidal neurons, relative to the weights of the interneurons, are generally smaller than they were in the previous simulations. By decreasing the weights of the evoked inputs to pyramidal neurons (and sometimes increasing the weights of the interneurons), we are decreasing the strength of the overall inputs, thereby testing our first hypothesis. 

Also, notice that the mean input times are larger for all inputs, and the variances has increased for the Proximal 2 input. This means that we are overall delaying the input arrival times to the network, thereby testing the second part of our hypothesis. 

<div style="display:block; width:90%; margin: 0 auto;">

### Figure 16 new param values vs. old param values. Highlight the old para values and compare them side-by-side

![](images/erp_fig_16.png)

</div>

Let’s reduce the number of trials to 2 for speed, change the simulation name, and run the simulation! This simulation should tell us how well our adjusted parameters fit the new non-detected data. 

<div style="display:block; width:90%; margin: 0 auto;">

### Figure 17 simulation result (joyce: the simulation doesn't seem to fit very well?)

![](images/erp_fig_17_no_trials_simulation.png)

</div>

With our new parameter set, the simulation is now a better fit to the experimental data (RMSE = ___). We can interprete these results as supporting our hypothesis that on non-detected trials, the feedback (distal 1) and late-feedforward (proximal 2) inputs to the network are more delayed, less synchronous, and overall weaker than on detected trials. -->
<p><strong>6.2 Simulating the Suprathreshold response</strong></p>
<p>For this part of the tutorial, we’ll load a different experimental
data set into the GUI. The new experimental data represents the evoked
response from supra-threshold level stimuli in the experiment. We will
adjust the parameters to better fit our simulation to the supra-detected
threshold level data.</p>
<p>First, let’s load the data from the supra-threshold detected trials
<code>S1_SupraT.txt</code> and the data from the threshold-level
detected trials <code>yes_trial_S1_ERP_all_avg</code>.</p>

<p>Notice that the two waveforms displayed have very different features,
including altered timing, amplitude, and sharpness of the peaks in this
new data set.</p>
<p>If we also load in the previous simulation of threshold-level
detected trials, <code>ERP_yes_3trials</code>, we can see that HNN
automatically calculate the model fit to both datasets loaded (i.e, the
RMSE between the average model response and the loaded data) based on
the threshold-level simulation, showing that
<code>ERPYes100Trials.json</code> gives a poor fit to the
supra-threshold data (RMSE = 30.31).</p>

<p>What might account for these differences between our simulation and
the data for the supra-threshold detected trials? We can formulate some
hypotheses and use HNN to test it.</p>
<p>Given the timing and magnitude differences we see in the plot, we can
hypothesize that these difference can be accounted by 1. An increase in
the strength of the inputs that created the evoked response, and 2. A
reduction in the delay in the arrival time of the inputs to the
network.</p>
<p>To test these hypotheses, we’ll adjust the parameters as described.
For simplicity, we have also created a parameter file that accounts for
such changes and accurately reproduces the new data. Load the
<code>ERPYesSuparT.json</code> file into
<code>External Drives</code>.</p>
<p>You should see the new values in the dropdowns.</p>
<p>Next, let’s run the simulation using the <code>Run</code> button.</p>

<h3>Figure 20</h3>

</section>
<p>Let’s take a look at the output. First, note that the previous
threshold-level simulation was not removed to allow comparison to the
new supra-threshold simulation. For the new suprathreshold detection
parameter set, there is now a better fit to the experimental data (RMSE
= 24.39), with all major waveform features in the experiment and
simulation in agreement. One interpretation of these results is that on
supra-threshold detected trials, both the feedforward and feedback
inputs are stronger, and both early and late feedforward inputs arrive
earlier. These trials have overall stronger inputs, which then promotes
tactile detection.</p>
<p><strong>6.2.2 Exercises for further exploration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Run 5 trials using the parameters from above. How does that impact
the RMSE?</li>
<li>Try manually adjusting the parameters to further reduce the
RMSE.</li>
<li>Try running the simulation for longer and adding an additional
proximal or distal drive; how does this affect the simulation?</li>
</ul>
